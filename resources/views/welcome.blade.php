                    <p>PMS is a project management that enables members who wish to undertake a project manage the project progress efficiently.
                        This is made possible by registering a team and a project to be undertaken and then allocating tasks derived from sprints, to team members that are assigned to their respective projects.
                        The PMS is specifically built to enable easy and efficient management of any type of projects.
